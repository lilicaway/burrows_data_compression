# Burrows–Wheeler data compression algorithm

This an assignment for the coursera course called [Algorithms part2](https://www.coursera.org/learn/algorithms-part2) from Princeton University.

Implement the [Burrows–Wheeler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burrows%E2%80%93Wheeler_transform) data compression algorithm. This revolutionary algorithm outcompresses gzip and PKZIP, is relatively easy to implement, and is not protected by any patents.
It forms the basis of the Unix compression utility bzip2.
